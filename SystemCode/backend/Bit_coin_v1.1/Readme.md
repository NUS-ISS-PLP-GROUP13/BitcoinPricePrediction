#### To run the system, we need to download other larger files like model weights and database files to support the whole system

* Download model1a pre-trained model parameters and weights [here is the link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhXWl5uPYwBog22EU8lat_QHQRgY?e=1Pkt25)  and put it into filepath Controller/Model1/
* Download database sql file [here is the link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhNOBSYLzOAhkiuSG5BtMddjuxfW?e=urflpg)and run them firstly to construct the database
